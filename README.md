Basic knowledge of TCP/IP

TCP/IP stand for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is the basic of internet protocol(协议）. Before there is not internet, parts of world already build their own little internet.

A language that can be understand world wide.

How to use TCP/IP?<br>
  1. Using TCP/IP to fix internet connection problem.<br>
    For example, Internet wire is connect, network adapter card is good, but there is no Internet.<br>
      Using ping to approximate the problem area.<br>
        a.Ping 127.0.0.1, if fail, it mean that local network TCP/IP is not working properly, please reinstall TCP/IP and try it           again.<br>
        b.Ping personal IP address, if fail, it mean that network adapter card is not correct.<br>
        c.Ping the local area network other computer IP address or Internet IP adress. If fail, it mean that wire is not                  connect. If success, but internet still not working, it mean that problem could cause by the internet software.
